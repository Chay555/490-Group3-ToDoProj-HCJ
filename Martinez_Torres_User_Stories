Jose User Stories – Website Design

As a user, I want to feel inspired to improve my productivity, along with giving me something pleasing to the eye after I log in so that I can look forward to coming back.

As a user, I want to use this web application without getting lost or confused with the features that are offered to me by being informed by a tutorial so that I can use the web application with little time wasted finding my way around the website.

As a user, I should be able to sort out my tasks daily, weekly, and monthly so that I can either get particular day-to-day tasks or be as broad as seeing tasks that I have done for the month. 

It’s my understanding that my primary role in this project is designing the aesthetics of the web application. Specifically, I am in charge of the application layout, and the color palette of the website. My portion of the project is independent of the others as adjusting the layout and design of the website has no effect on the database or login system.
